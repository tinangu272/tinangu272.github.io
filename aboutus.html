<h1 class=titleau> About Us </h1>
<body class="header">
  <h1 class="headers"> Why We Made the Website </h1>
    <p class="regtext"> This website was made by Amal Chaudry, Juliana Yagyu, Sophie Navalta, and Tina Nguyen for our Girls Who Code Final Project. Girls Who Code is a program that teaches coding to girls in grades 6-12, aiming to end the gender gap in computer science. With the knowledge we have learned from the program we created Georgia Solutions. </p>
    <p class="regtext"> We created Georgia Solutions to make volunteering opportunities easier to find and to educate people would like to volunteer. When we are looking for places to volunteer, sometimes we don't know where we can volunteer and what type of volunteering we want to sign up for. Our vision is to encourage more people to volunteer and help their community. </p>
  <h1 class="headers"> The Purpose of Each Section </h1>
    <p class="regtext"> The image map on our home page offers a variety of volunteering opporuntities in your county, making it easier for you to find volunteering opportunities. If you do not know much about volunteering, we also made the Volunteering Information tab. This tab lists the benefits and expectations of volunteering in each category. </p>
    <p class="regtext"> Other features we added are the quizzes and donate tab. The quizzes tab has a list of quizzes that test your knowledge on worldwide problems. The quizzes can teach you shocking facts about why we need volunteers for many different issues. The donation tab is where you can donate money to different organizations that support important issues. </p>
  <h1 class="headers"> Other Important Information </h1>
    <p class="regtext"> We decided to offer volunteering oppportunities only in Georgia because the United States is too big of an area to find volunteering opportuntiies for. In the future, we hope to expand the website to other states as well. </p>
